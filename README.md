Lighthouse
==========

A study project I created to replicate rotation via vibration as done by the famed Cycloramic app. Needs iPhone 5

##Instructions on running the app
---------------------------------
* Place the iPhone 5 with its base down in a flat and really smooth surface 
* Swipe up or down to control number of cycles/loops to execute
* Touch anywhere on the screen to show a countdown and then start firing
* If need to cancel between execution, swipe left
* 0.4 seconds has been found out as the optimum trigger interval and is the default, but feel free to play around using the controls
* Any of the effects can be turned off to see just the others in action


##Note to developers
--------------------
The app uses Cocoapods to install dependencies, but the Pods directory has not been checked in to Github. So once you Clone or Fork the project to your local machine, navigate into the directory and issue the **'pod install'** command to download dependencies. 


####Errata
This is my first project in Github, and so I have goofed up the version control mechanism and I see multiple revision histories for the same change. My apologies. But this shouldn't prevent you from running or testing the project. Just FYI.
